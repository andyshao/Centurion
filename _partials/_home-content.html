  <h1>About the Framework</h1>
  
  <p>Centurion is an intuitive, responsive framework that works out of the box with basic features added to help aid your next web project.</p>
    
  <p>Unlike other larger and more prominent web frameworks, Centurion is designed was originally designed for desktop experiences, but has been rebuilt from the ground up to feature to be responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences. Using CSS3 media queries, Centurion is able to conform easily to any screen and shift the content as necessary (or hide certain elements) to allow for an unobstructed view of the content and elements that matter most for the experience.</p>
  
  <p>Centurion offers three basic media breakpoints: 481, 961, and 1100. Even the grid has been optimized to be design friendly with a 24-column grid that is easily divisible for any design project and it even has different columns based on device (6-columns for mobile and 12-columns for tablet). </p>

  <h2>Out of the Box</h2>
  
  <p>Centurion wasn't meant to be the end of a theme, rather it is the beginning of the next great one. Most of the features exist based on usage and need from the open-source community. Building basic features for typography, tables, and buttons can become tiresome and for a quick web development project you might need the simple features first with the ability to create your own without excessive overrides.</p>
    
  <h3>Build for your needs</h3>
  
  <p>You can either use the responsive grid at the core of Centurion, or you can extend it with the basic features you need easily with Sass mixins.</p>
