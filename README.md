Centurion is a responsive web framework built for speed and simplicity with it's scalable and easy syntax to get a new prototype up quickly, as well as, support browsers as far back as IE7 to ensure your website works from the grid up. It is built on CSS3 with HTML5 in mind to allow you to start capitalizing on the next web standard (that has been around for a decade).

If you're worried about browser support we recommend using [html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) to add fallback for HTML5 or [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) to provide basic support for CSS3 and other feature detection to keep your design from falling flat, unless you designed it that way.


## Versioning

Current version: `3.5.3`



## NPM

### Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

`npm install centurion-framework --save-dev`


Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

`grunt.loadNpmTasks('centurion-framework');`

### Usage

For best results it is recommended to add Centurion to your Sass `loadPath` and include portions of the framework as needed. If you're using `grunt-contrib-sass` you add that like this:

```
'sass': {
  target: {
    options: {
      loadPath: â€˜node_modules/centurion-framework/lib/sass/'
    },
    files: {
      'path/to.css': 'path/to.scss'
    }
  }
}
```



## RubyGem

### Getting Started

Install the gem: `gem install centurion-framework`

If you have an existing project: `require 'centurion-framework'`

### Configuration

You also have the option of importing Centurion components as needed into your project. Start by including the entire library at the top of your Sass file:

`@import "centurion-framework";`

Then you can include any of the modules from Centurion that you need. For example if you wanted to only include normalize, the Centurion grid, and typography then you would add the following:

```
@include normalize;
@include column-grid;
@include typography;
```
